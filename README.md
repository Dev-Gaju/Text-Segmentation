# Text-Segmentation
Its a Kaggle competition Where you have to find out the text which belongs to which class. We know about image segmentation for same type work with text here work with text segmentation.
Every in that commpetion use LongFormer becasue we know transformer represent model like bert and roberta have limitation. Those model can accect only 512 token due to memeory space,
but in longformer here it can accecpt 4096 token.

Like convolution network in this model researchers introduce slideing and and three others scop to extarct token from text.
